# GELATINOUSSLIME_RM_MOD_BUILD_1 — build RM_GelatinousSlime as its own RimMandrake mod

**the Slime - twin pair, mod EXISTS; TITANOSLIME_SLIME_BIOME_1 builds here**

Phase A row 18 of `design/RimMandrake/biome_mod_architecture.md`. Parent:
`BIOME_MOD_SPLIT_EXECUTION_1`. Governed by `BIOME_PAINT_ONCE_AT_THE_END_1`.


## spec

🔑 **`biome_mod_architecture.md` §5 Phase A is the authority — read it, do not re-derive
it from here.** Steps 1–6, restated only far enough to start:

1. **Scaffold** `About/About.xml` with `mandrake.rm.gelatinousslime`, `loadAfter` on the §2d shared libraries,
   a `ModSettings` class with the master toggle (§6), an empty `Defs/BiomeDefs/`.
   `deploy_custom_mods.py --mod <name>` dry run, then `--apply`.
2. **Copy the content in** as `RM_GelatinousSlime` — the BiomeDef plus its terrain, plant, weather,
   condition and hediff defs, textures, and the kit C# under namespace
   `RimMandrake.<Mod>`. ⛔ Every `RSW_`/`SW_`/`RUT_` entry in `<wildAnimals>` stays OUT and
   goes to `src/RimUtinni/UtinniPatches/Patches/WildAnimals_<Biome>.xml` as a
   `PatchOperationAdd` onto `RM_GelatinousSlime`, with `MayRequire="mandrake.rsw.swbestiary"`.
   `WildAnimals_Pyrelands.xml` is the existing shape. Any donor `workerClass`
   (`AlphaBiomes.*`, `VanillaBiomes.*`, `BiomesPlus.*`, `ReGrowthCore.*`) becomes this
   mod's own `RM_BiomeWorker_<X>` — a donor type in `workerClass` is a hard dependency the
   RimMandrake tier may not assume.
3. **FREEZE the `RUT_` def, do not delete it.** It carries the player's world until the
   terminal paint. Byte-for-byte as it is, one header comment only: *"carrying the world
   until the terminal paint; content lives in `mandrake.rm.gelatinousslime`; do not edit here."* From that moment
   every content fix lands in `RM_GelatinousSlime` only.
4. **Retarget what does not need to be on the world** (kit specs, `_def_bindings_*.md`,
   queue items, `validation.py` `QUALIFYING_BIOMES`, kit C# string constants). Anything
   that must keep working on the live world (`BiomeNames_Ashkarr.xml`,
   `BiomeDescriptions_Ashkarr.xml`, doctrine patches, `race/wildBiomes`,
   `gen_cast_patch.py` output) gets a **second** op for `RM_GelatinousSlime` beside the `RUT_` one, so
   both behave identically until Phase B.
5. **Prove it loads and plays** — minimal list + this mod + `mandrake.rut.patches` +
   **all five expansions** (owner, 2026-09-19: every test list carries every expansion).

## verify

- Zero new Config errors in `Player.log` — and 🔴 grep the log, `validate_patch.py` cannot
  see config errors.
- `validate_patch.py <path> --live --defs` on the new Utinni fauna patch. An unmatched
  `PatchOperationAdd` is **silent**, so a clean run is not proof a row landed — confirm
  from a post-load def dump.
- A quicktest map on a **scratch** world whose landing tile is set to `RM_GelatinousSlime` through
  `jawa/world_*` at `Page_SelectStartingSite`. ⛔ Never the canonical save.
- `deploy_custom_mods.py` plan read before `--apply`; a `-` line is a deletion, look at it.

## criteria

`mandrake.rm.gelatinousslime` exists, deploys, and loads clean carrying `RM_GelatinousSlime` with its own content and its own
Mod Settings screen; the `RUT_` twin is frozen with its header and unchanged; the Star Wars
fauna ride a Utinni patch rather than the RimMandrake def; one commit, explicit paths, the
message naming what the twin got wrong; and the mod is appended to
`WORLD_REMAKE_FINAL_STEP_1`'s paint list.

## Watch out

- ⛔ **Do not paint, and do not cite a tile count as evidence about this biome.** The planet
  is painted ONCE, at the end. A def of ours carrying 0 tiles is the expected mid-migration
  state, not a defect.
- ⛔ **Do not delete the `RUT_` def.** Deleting a painted def before Phase B destroys the
  save.
- ⚠️ A `<li>` in the wrong place discards the WHOLE def, silently.
